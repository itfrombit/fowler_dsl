INTRODUCTION

This is a Nu implementation of a Domain Specific Language example that
appeared in the following article by Martin Fowler:
 "Language Workbenches: The Killer-App for Domain Specific Languages?"
 http://martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html

This Nu version is adapted from a nicely-done Common Lisp version of
the example by Rainer Joswig.  After Rainer saw the Java and C# versions
that Martin Fowler and others had done in the above article, he knew he
could do better.

Rainer has an article explaining his take on the example problem:

Even better, watch Rainer's screencast in which he develops
the solution from scratch in about 15 minutes using Common Lisp.

I ported Rainer's Common Lisp version to Nu as part of testing out
the new macro-1 features in Nu 0.4.  I added a simple dispatching
mechanism and some sample debugging output as part of the 
code-generation in the macro.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This code requires Nu 0.4 or above.
